# View

View is a Dart web library for building web user interfaces. It is inspired by React and Flutter, and it is designed to be simple, fast, and easy to use.

It's highly customizable and can be used with any Dart package that can run on the web.

The project can be compiled to wasm for Chromium based browsers, others use the dart2js compiler. See Issue [Wasm-GC WebAssembly Garbage Collection Proposal](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=247394)
